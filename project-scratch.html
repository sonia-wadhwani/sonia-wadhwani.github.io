        <strong><center>Scratch Project -  Time to Parallel Park</center></Strong>
        <p><strong>Project Objective:</strong> To develop problem-solving and programming skills by creating a functional parking game in Scratch.</p>
        <p><strong>The Approach:</strong> Players control a car to navigate a parking lot and park in a designated spot. The game utilizes loops to control the car's movement and functions to handle specific actions like turning and checking for obstacles. A restricted pivot adds realism to the driving experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Coding Elements:</strong> The game employs a variety of coding elements to create a realistic and engaging parking experience. Loops, both for and while, are used to control the car's movement and check conditions. Functions are defined to modularize the code and handle specific tasks like turning and checking for obstacles. Sound effects enhance the user experience by providing auditory feedback. Sprites are used to represent the car, parking spots, and other objects in the game. The game responds to user input, such as keyboard presses, to control the car's movement. Additionally, zone-based interactions are implemented to adjust the car's behavior based on its location within the parking lot.</p>
